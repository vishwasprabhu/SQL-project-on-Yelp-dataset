# SQL-project-on-Yelp-dataset
Sentiment analysis using keywords to predict average rating and business viability.

I have used the open source yelp dataset publicly available for download at https://www.yelp.com/dataset

I would be doing a sentiment text analysis to find relationship between the sentiments from the text to the average star rating and to 
predicting the business open/close scenario. 

I would be using number of businesses in each of the open/close group along with average number of reviews, total number of reviews and 
average star rating. I would try to predict the average sentiment from the text of the review using limited number of positive and 
negative words and correlate it to predict whether the business will remain open/close. 

The sentiment analysis actually gives the customer behavior and can be used to preddict if the business can survive or not (Open/close) 
along with average star rating. It can be seen from output that the average sentiment and average star rating is better for businesses 
that are still open when compared to the ones that are closed.

A high average sentiment means the review text had more positive words or less negative words in the overall count.
